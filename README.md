# Finding Discriminative Attributes 
Code and documentation for the SemEval 2018 shared task 'Capturing Discriminative Attributes':

Shiva Taslimipoor, Omid Rohanian, Le An Ha, Gloria Corpas, Ruslan Mitkov: Wolves at SemEval-2018 Task 10 (2018): Semantic
Discrimination based on Knowledge and Association. In *Proceedings of The 12th International Workshop on Semantic Evaluation*, pp. 972-976.

For this shared task we developed a classification system to determine whether an attribute word can distinguish one word from another.
To model semantic difference, we define a discriminative score as follows:

*DISC-Score(w1,w2,attr) = Score(w1, attr)âˆ’Score(w2, attr)*

where w1,w2 and attr are the first, second, and third word respectively. Score is a variable function of relation between two words which we compute from different resources.

We make use of a variety of different association measures derived from huge corpora, and also pre-trained distributional semantic vectors. To augment our method with structured knowledge, we utilise [a knowledge-based ontology](http://conceptnet.io/). We use the feature set in supervised and unsupervised settings.

In summary, we have four sets of different *Score*s each used in computing *DISC-Score*s.

In order to speed up the evaluation, in this repo we upload all the pre-computed scores in separate folders ([ConceptNet](http://conceptnet.io), [Sketch Engine](https://www.sketchengine.co.uk/), [Google Ngrams](http://phrasefinder.io), and Word2vec Similarity). In the script `classify.py`, we load these scores and feed them as features to the classifier.

### To Do
The scripts for computing each set of scores will be uploaded in their corresponding directories.
